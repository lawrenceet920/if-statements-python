### Station 2: Everyday Decisions
- Offline
- List three (3) specific decisions you have to make each day
- Use the format shown below, i.e., start each sentence with the keyword **if** and then write what you do when you have to make that decision

### Station 3: PRIMM Activity
- Offline 
- Study the sample code on the handout
- Answer the questions about the sample code
- Check your answers against the answer key your teacher provides

---
### Station 4: Debugging
- Offline
- Debug each if statement shown on the handout
- Write your correction next to the if statement on the handout
- Check your answers against the answer key your teacher provides

---
### Station 5: Simple If Statements Practice
- Use VS Code
- REMEMBER: Upload your script for Station 5 to a new repo you create on GitHub
- Be prepared to discuss your work during Teacher Time

#### Task 1
- Create a Python list named **superheroes**
- Add 5 - 6 superheroes to your list
- Use an if statement and the **in** membership operator to check whether the list contains your favorite superhero
- If your favorite superhero IS contained in the list, print a message that says who your favorite superhero is
- **HINT**: See the examples of different if statements in your copied GitHub repository 

#### Task 2
- Define a variable that contains the score you earned on a recent quiz (85, 92, etc.)
- Use an if statement to display at message that says you earned a B if your quiz score was an 85 or above

#### Task 3
- Assign a quote from your favorite book or movie to a variable named *quote*
- Use the Python `startswith()` method and an if statement to check whether your quote starts with the uppercase letter 'M'
- If it does, print a message that says the quote starts with an uppercase M

#### Task 4
- Define a variable named *filename* and assign it the name of a file that ends with the **.png** file extension
- Use an if statement and the `endswith()` method to check whether the filename ends with the **.png** file extension or not
- Display a message that says the filename ends with the **.png** extension if indeed it does


#### Task 5
- Write a short script that checks whether you're registered for classes at Northwestern Michigan College
- Define a new variable named `is_registered` and assign it a Boolean value
- Then use an if statement and a condition to check whether your variable has been set to `False` (meaning you're NOT registered for classes)
- Display a message that says whether or not you are registered (for classes at NMC)
